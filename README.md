### Backstory

- Things I understand are way less exciting than things I don't understand.
- As a kid I got a copy of RPG Maker for the original Playstation and realized I
was spending weeks (ab)using the simple logic editor in that game to build
things it was never meant to build
- My dad said "hey that sounds like computer programming maybe try that"
- Checked out some Dummies books from the library and found coding fun.
- Taught myself Linux in the same way - checking out a Red Hat 7 book from the
library with the install CDs still in the back and just screwing around with
~how you could break~ what you could do with a "free OS" taught me a ton of basic operating system
theory.
- A few years later I was compiling my own Linux kernels with my own kconfig for kicks.
- A few more years later got a BS in Software Engineering.
- Open-source is the best software development paradigm I've come across - it's
the world I grew up in and it's the world I feel most comfortable in.

### What I do for money right now

Architect, designer, and programming language polyglot most at home with an
open-source stack in a Linux/Unix/macOS environment. Have been accused by
peers of being creative, intuitive, pessimistic, and a disciplined engineer, but I would like to take this opportunity to clear my name and reject those accusations. Except maybe "pessimistic", I'll cop to that.

Rust/Go/Javascript/Terraform/Shell/Python are what I work with daily.

### What I'm doing for fun right now

- Getting past the borrow checker hump with Rust
- Getting "good at" Rust
- Shaving yaks with Emacs (using Vim keybinds)
- Failing to keep up with quantum computing theory
- Reading books on macroeconomics
- Collecting, repairing, and modifying 90's-era video game consoles
- Playing old Japanese vertically-scrolling shoot-em-ups, badly
- Pretending to be a race car driver and watching F1
- Listening to 1978-1985-era UK post-punk
- Keeping up with the burgeoning FPGA-based video game hardware emulation scene.

### Dumb thing I'm most proud of doing

- Despite having no soldering or electronics experience, I replaced all the
  capacitors in the guts of an old CRT television without electrocuting myself, and it
  worked. I now use this television to play 90's-era video game consoles. Because I have done this, and *not* died, I will die a proud man.

### What I think is important

- Keeping the joy, fun and sense of play and discovery at the center of all work, personal
  or professional, and protecting the right of others to keep it there too.
